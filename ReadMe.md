How to run?
I have added a make file to easy out the compilation process

- run, git clone https://github.com/rohitrai1/OPSWAT.git
- replace the existing key in the key.txt with your metadefeander key

- run the command "make compile" to generate class files 
- run command "make run ARGS=YOUR_FILE_LOCATION"
	- for example; make run ARGS=malware_samples/Trojan.NSIS.Win32/Trojan.NSIS.Win32.zip
- run make clean if you want to clean the class files that were generated by make compile
- demonstrated the above steps in the screenshot below

I have added JUnit tests for each request, however, additional jar is needed to run on your local machine
The results of the tests are shown below,
