How to run?
- I have added a make file to easy out the compilation process
- run, git clone https://github.com/rohitrai1/OPSWAT.git
- run the command "make compile" to generate class files 
- run command "make run ARGS=YOUR_FILE_LOCATION"
	- for example; make run ARGS=malware_samples/Trojan.NSIS.Win32/Trojan.NSIS.Win32.zip
- run make clean if you want to clean the class files that were generated by make compile
- demonstrated this in the screenshot below
